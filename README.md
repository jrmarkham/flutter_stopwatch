# stopwatch

For sturture: I used my favorite design pattern of domain driven design. The cubit and model and pretty complete. I'd consider moving ome code from the cubit into a mixin, but the class length is fewer than 50 lines so probaly unnessary. The display is broken into widgets. I'd probably create individual buttons on a production app and move some of the functions into mixins or utils.
